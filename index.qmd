# Preface {.unnumbered}

This online tutorial serves as a hands-on guide for researchers 
to replicate the simulation described in 

[our paper].  

This supplementary material was designed with regard to support applied 
researchers (*not* statisticians) to adapt the simulation with required 
parameters for their own study. 
Consequently, the content is split in the following chapters:  

- Chapter 1 gives an overview of the technical requirements

- Chapter 2 describes step-by-step how to conduct the simulation for a specific research study,
  based on parallel or stepped wedge CRTs, furthermore show the comparison of several fidelity patterns 

 - Chapter 3 optionally provides additional statistical information, but does *not* need to be consulted 
   to be able to run the simulation
